description: pstack per-role model choices (overrides skill defaults)
alwaysApply: true
---
# pstack model configuration. One line per role. Delete a line to fall back to the skill default.
# `inherit-parent` or `auto` as a value: the role runs on the parent chat model (omit Task `model`). Alias entries in a panel list still count toward its fan-out.
# Run `/setup-pstack` to replace inherit-parent with real model slugs available in your session.
